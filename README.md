# Servo Motor Tester

A simple Arduino sketch to test a servo motor by sweeping it from 0Â° to 180Â° and back.

## ðŸ“Œ Hardware Required:
- Arduino Uno
- Servo Motor (e.g., SG90)
- Jumper Wires

## ðŸ”Œ Wiring:
- Servo VCC â†’ 5V
- Servo GND â†’ GND
- Servo Signal â†’ D9

## ðŸš€ How It Works:
The servo will continuously sweep between 0 and 180 degrees.
